Taking this Edge—which may only be selected once per Rank—means the cybernetic hero manages to achieve the necessary resources and opportunity to have a new piece of cybernetic technology installed, or have one upgraded to a higher degree. Though the GM has final say on what is and is not appropriate, anything in the Cybernetics section is fair game otherwise." compset="Edge" summary="Add a new piece of cyberware of your choice">
